title: "Students Initial Setup"
---

You may have noticed that there are no formal prerequisites for this course. This was a conscious decision, as I wanted to keep the door open to as many excited students with different backgrounds as possible. But I want to make sure that interested students understand expectations and are prepared to put in the time to fill any potential gaps via self study, ideally before the quarter begins.
