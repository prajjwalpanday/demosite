Write a Python program that prints(displays) your name, address, and telephone number.\n\n**Q2**. Evaluate the following code at shell prompt: Then assign **name** an appropirate value, and evaluate the statement again. \n\n```\nprint(\"Your name is\", name)\n```\n\n**Q3**. Open and IDLE window, and enter the program from Figure 1.7 that computes the area of a rectangle. Load the program into the shell by pressing the F5 key, and correct any errors that occur. Test the program with different inputs by running at least three times.\n\n\n```{{python}}\nwidth = int(input(\"Enter the width: \"))\nheight = int(input(\"Enter the height: \"))\narea = width * height\nprint(\"The area is\", area, \"square units.\")\n\n```\n\n### Final submission\n\n",
